## Morning Reflection

### How am I feeling?

I woke up feeling refreshed and energized. There's a clarity in my mind this morning that makes me feel optimistic about the day ahead.

### What are my intentions for today?

My main intention is to make progress on the project I've been working on. I want to approach it with patience and focus, taking breaks when needed rather than pushing through fatigue.

## Evening Reflection

### What happened today?

The morning went really well - I had about three hours of deep, focused work where I made significant progress. After lunch, though, I found my energy and focus waning. I took a walk which helped, but I still struggled to maintain the same level of productivity.

### What went well?

I'm proud of myself for finally tackling that challenging task I'd been avoiding. Once I broke it down into smaller steps, it wasn't nearly as daunting as I'd built it up to be in my mind. The walk was also a great decision - it cleared my head and lifted my mood.

### What could have gone better?

I could have been more realistic about my afternoon capacity. Instead of trying to power through when I was tired, I should have done lighter tasks or taken a longer break. My todo list also feels overwhelming because I'm not prioritizing effectively.

### What did I learn?

Two key insights today:
1. Procrastination often comes from a task feeling too big or unclear. Breaking it down makes it manageable.
2. My energy naturally dips in the afternoon, so I should plan accordingly - schedule deep work in the morning and lighter tasks later.

## Gratitude

I'm grateful for the clarity and energy I had this morning, for my comfortable workspace, and for the flexibility to take a break when I needed it.

## Looking Forward

Tomorrow I want to start with some exercise to boost my energy for the whole day. I'll focus on just one or two major tasks rather than trying to do everything at once.
